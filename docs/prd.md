# Product Requirements Document: Company Docs Q&A Bot

## Project Overview

**Product Name:** Docs-Bot  
**Version:** v0.0.1-baseline  
**Project Type:** Hybrid RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) Application  
**Target Deployment:** Replit with single-server architecture  

## Executive Summary

Docs-Bot is an intelligent document Q&A system that allows users to upload company documents and ask natural language questions, receiving accurate, source-grounded responses with inline citations. The system combines semantic search with keyword matching (hybrid search) to provide the most relevant answers from uploaded content.

## Core Value Proposition

- **30-second demo story:** Upload a PDF → Ask "What is our vacation policy?" → Get instant answer with exact page citations
- **Grounding:** Every answer includes clickable source citations
- **Reliability:** Built-in confidence scoring and source verification
- **Ship-ability:** Single-page web app with simple deployment

## Target Users

- **Primary:** Small to medium teams needing quick access to company documentation
- **Secondary:** HR teams, new employees, managers seeking policy clarification
- **Use Case Examples:** 
  - "What's our remote work policy?"
  - "How do I submit expenses?"
  - "What are the requirements for promotion?"

## Functional Requirements

### 1. Document Management

- **File Validation:** Ensure file types are supported and file sizes are reasonable (<10MB per file)
- **Document Processing:** Automatic chunking and embedding generation
- **Document List:** Display uploaded documents with delete functionality

### 2. Question & Answer System
- **Query Interface:** Clean, search-box style input for natural language questions
- **Response Generation:** AI-powered answers using OpenAI GPT models
- **Citation System:** Inline citations with clickable references to source passages
- **Confidence Scoring:** Display confidence level for each answer
- **Source Drawer:** Expandable panel showing relevant document excerpts

### 3. Search & Retrieval
- **Hybrid Search:** Combine semantic similarity (embeddings) with keyword matching
- **Ranking Algorithm:** Top-k retrieval with relevance scoring
- **Context Window:** Manage token limits for optimal LLM processing
- **Search History:** Store recent queries for user convenience

### 4. User Experience
- **Single Page Application:** All functionality accessible from one interface
- **Responsive Design:** Works on desktop and mobile devices
- **Real-time Feedback:** Loading states and progress indicators
- **Error Handling:** Clear error messages and recovery suggestions

## Technical Requirements

### Architecture
- **Single Server Application:** All functionality in one deployable unit (Replit compatible)
- **Frontend & Backend:** Integrated web application
- **File Storage:** Local file system or in-memory processing
- **Database:** Optional lightweight storage (SQLite or in-memory)

### Performance
- **Response Time:** Answers delivered within 5 seconds
- **Concurrent Users:** Support 10+ simultaneous users
- **File Processing:** Documents processed within 30 seconds of upload
- **Search Latency:** Sub-second search results

### Security & Privacy
- **Environment Variables:** Secure API key management via .env files
- **File Sanitization:** Validate and sanitize uploaded files
- **Session Management:** Basic session handling for multi-user support
- **Data Retention:** Clear policy on document storage and deletion

## Technology Stack Recommendation

Given the Replit deployment constraint and your available resources, here's the optimal stack:

### **Recommended: Flask-based Application**

**Why Flask over Next.js:**
- Single server deployment (no separate API server needed)
- Better integration with Python ML/AI ecosystem
- Simpler embedding and vector operations
- Direct OpenAI Python SDK integration
- Built-in file upload handling

**Core Stack:**
```
Backend: Flask + Python 3.9+
Frontend: Jinja2 templates + vanilla JavaScript + Tailwind CSS
Vector Store: Qdrant Cloud (your free account)
Embeddings: OpenAI text-embedding-3-small
LLM: OpenAI GPT-4 or GPT-3.5-turbo
Search: scikit-learn for BM25 + Qdrant for semantic search
File Processing: PyPDF2 for PDFs, markdown for .md files
```

**Dependencies:**
```
flask==2.3.3
openai==1.3.0
qdrant-client==1.6.0
PyPDF2==3.0.1
markdown==3.5.1
scikit-learn==1.3.0
numpy==1.24.3
python-dotenv==1.0.0
```

### Alternative Considerations
- **Next.js:** Would require API routes, more complex for Replit
- **MongoDB:** Unnecessary complexity for document storage
- **Neo4j:** Overkill for basic RAG, reserve for future GraphRAG features

## User Stories

### Epic 1: Document Upload
- **As a user**, I want to upload PDF and Markdown files so that I can ask questions about their content
- **As a user**, I want to see a list of uploaded documents so that I know what content is available
- **As a user**, I want to delete documents so that I can manage my document collection

### Epic 2: Question Answering
- **As a user**, I want to ask natural language questions so that I can get information from my documents
- **As a user**, I want to see source citations so that I can verify the accuracy of answers
- **As a user**, I want to see confidence scores so that I can assess answer reliability

### Epic 3: Search & Discovery
- **As a user**, I want to see relevant document excerpts so that I can understand the context
- **As a user**, I want to click on citations so that I can read the full source passage
- **As a user**, I want to see suggested follow-up questions so that I can explore topics further

## Success Metrics

### Technical Metrics
- **Answer Accuracy:** >80% of answers include relevant citations
- **Response Time:** <5 seconds average response time
- **Upload Success:** >95% successful document processing
- **Search Relevance:** Top-3 results contain relevant information >85% of the time

### User Experience Metrics
- **Demo Success:** 30-second demo completion rate >90%
- **Citation Usage:** Users click citations >60% of the time
- **Question Clarity:** Users ask follow-up questions >40% of the time

## MVP Definition

**Minimum Viable Product includes:**
1. Upload 3-10 PDF/Markdown files
2. Ask natural language questions
3. Receive answers with inline citations
